# Election-Analysis-Challenge-module-3

## Overview of Election Audit: 
The purpose of this analysis was to audit the tabulated election results of a US Congressional Precinct for the Colorado Board of Elections.  Data collected from three sources (mail in votes, punch card votes, and electronic votes) had already been combined into a single csv file, named election_results.csv, which was the data source for this exercise.  The initial work was focused on extracting the total number of votes cast, the total number of votes for each candidate, the percentage of votes for each candidate, and the winner of the election based on the popular vote.  Then I performed an additional analysis of the total votes cast by county, the percentage of votes registered by each county, and determination of which county had the largest turnout of voters.

## Election-Audit Results: 
Using a bulleted list, address the following election outcomes. Use images or examples of your code as support where necessary.

## Election-Audit Summary:
